Top Things/Currently Working On

- To add images it is needed to add a window manager - i.e. some heavy re-ordering
- Ability to add images to story (markup)

Things Targeted For 1.0 Release:

- Documentation/Tutorial
- A bug fix round

Things Targeted For 2.0 Release:

- Error messages
- Text boxing/speech segment bubbles
- Setting text to be centered
- Variable definitions (e.g. not choices but setting a variable that can be referred later - e.g. having an item in inventory or specific piece of knowledge)
- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Logging
- Screen resolution scaleability (settings menu in general)
- TextHandler should handle a single box of text not a full story
- StoryHandler shoul dbe created to manage a story

Known Bugs

- Text can go across the border of the window - particularly question choice text
- At a choice loop an extra line loop seems to be added
- When loading a game we go to the start of a segment even if the save was in the middle, after choices in the segment. We should start after the last choice made.

Nice Things With No Current Release Version

- Scroll bar to look at previous text
- It might be worthwhile redoing the markup format and not do a single forward pass type thing but rather use getLine format.
- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Rename texthandler to storyhandler
- Proper text box asking user if should overwrite saved game
- Loading a game should check if choice history is valid
- Timed text, cna be used anywhere but specifically for showing that a game has been saved

Features With No Current Release Version

A Little Bit Far Of Features

- TTS reading

Questions

- Is there any benefit to the string/double definition of markup types?
- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing an dhaving the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
