Top Things/Currently Working On

- Test story demonstrating all features

Things Targeted For 1.0 Release:

- Documentation/Tutorial
- Text to write in story before choice is made and what text to show after depending on choice. Currently the choice text is just added to shown text.
- Press enter to continue text box scrolling

Things Targeted For 2.0 Release:

- Text is not contained in Choicebox. Make shared box code for ensuring boundaries are respected and for proper drawing.
- Error messages
- Setting text to be centered
- Variable definitions (e.g. not choices but setting a variable that can be referred later - e.g. having an item in inventory or specific piece of knowledge). Ability to remove variables.
- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Logging
- Screen resolution scaleability (settings menu in general)
- Background image markup should allow setting an actual image and not just change colour.
- Font markup should also have a type to change font size and colour and font itself.
- Load fonts as resources for each story
- Press button to speed up text
- Resources should also load borders to allow for changing bordes (including a setting)

Known Bugs

Nice Things With No Current Release Version

- Scroll bar to look at previous text
- Borders for boxes
- It might be worthwhile redoing the markup format and not do a single forward pass type thing but rather use getLine format.
- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Proper text box asking user if should overwrite saved game
- Loading a game should check if choice history is valid
- Timed text, cna be used anywhere but specifically for showing that a game has been saved
- Loading of resources not in story outputs an error which should be ignored. Suppress.

Features With No Current Release Version
- Markup to stop text moving for a timed period.
- Screen tiles (currently fixed to 3 boxes, should be changeable)
- Rumble effect (vary pos for draw)
- Colour effect
- Ability to change background
- Text appearance method markup
- Random choices
- Negative Conditional Choices
- Choices whose text is different when choosing from when put on screen after

A Little Bit Far Of Features

- TTS reading
- ASR choices
- Graphical Story Writing Tool (drag and drop diagram style)

Questions

- Is there any benefit to the string/double definition of markup types?
- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing and having the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
- Should boxes draw to their own texture and then draw that texture on the screen?
- Should strings long enough to go beyond text borders on their own wrap or just go past end as is now?
- When saving a game we "reset" to the beginning of the segment by removing the choices we've already go in history from that segment. Should tha tbe different?
- Can a loop be created if a story involves an optional choice which is the only one leading to the end?
