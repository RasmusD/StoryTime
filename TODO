Nice Things

- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Scroll bar to look at previous text
- Screen resolution scaleability
- Support preset colour values of sfml
- LINESPACE should change automatically if CHARSIZE changes
- CHARSIZE should change automatically if screen resolution is changed (maybe...)
- It might be worthwhile redoing the markup format and not do a single forward pass type thing but rather use getLine format.
- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Rename texthandler to storyhandler
- Border for text

Questions

- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing an dhaving the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
