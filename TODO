Top Things/Currently Working On

- Markup for showing (not choosing) different text based on previous choice
- GlobalSettings should probably be reworked to some object and contain methods etc to do default settings.

Known Bugs

- Text written for a choice tht has been made does not check for screen width/if newline should be made
- Escaped in markup " " show up with escape character

Nice Things

- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Scroll bar to look at previous text

- Support preset colour values of sfml
- LINESPACE should change automatically if CHARSIZE changes
- CHARSIZE should change automatically if screen resolution is changed (maybe...)

- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Rename texthandler to storyhandler
