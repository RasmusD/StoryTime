Top Things/Currently Working On

- Ability to add "choices" that only have one option

Things Targeted For 1.0 Release:

- Setting defaults in story script (font, colours, background, etc.)
- Documentation/Tutorial
- Ability to add images to text (markup)
- Ability to change background image/colour
- Loading stories
- Save files

Things Targeted For 2.0 Release:

- Variable definitions (e.g. not choices but setting a variable that can be referred later - e.g. having an item in inventory or specific piece of knowledge)

Known Bugs

- Text written for a choice that has been made does not check for screen width/if newline should be made
- If speed is too high sometimes issues seem to appear around newlines.
- Text can go across the border of the window

Nice Things

- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Scroll bar to look at previous text
- Screen resolution scaleability (settings menu in general)
- It might be worthwhile redoing the markup format and not do a single forward pass type thing but rather use getLine format.
- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Rename texthandler to storyhandler

Features
- Rumble effect (vary pos for draw)
- Colour effect
- Ability to change background
- Text appearance method markup
- Speech bubble use

A Little Bit Far Of Features

- TTS
- Graphical Story Writing Tool (drag and drop diagram style)

Questions

- Is there any benefit to the string/double definition of markup types?
- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing an dhaving the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
