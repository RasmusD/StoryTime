Top Things/Currently Working On

- LINESPACE should change automatically if CHARSIZE changes
- CHARSIZE should change automatically if screen resolution is changed (maybe...)
- GlobalSettings should probably be reworked to some static object and contain methods etc to do default settings.

Known Bugs

- Text written for a choice that has been made does not check for screen width/if newline should be made
- If speed is too high sometimes issues seem to appear around newlines.

Nice Things

- Rename texthandler to storyhandler
- Border for text
- Documentation/Tutorial

A Little Bit Far Of Features

- TTS
- Ability to add images to text (markup)

Questions

- Is there any benefit to the string/double definition of markup types?
- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing an dhaving the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
