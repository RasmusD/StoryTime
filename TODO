Top Things/Currently Working On

- To add images it is needed to add a window manager - i.e. some heavy re-ordering and bumping of some features
- Order and set up image, text and choice box as necessary
- Ability to add images to story (markup)

Things Targeted For 1.0 Release:

- Documentation/Tutorial
- A bug fix round

Things Targeted For 2.0 Release:

- Error messages
- Setting text to be centered
- Variable definitions (e.g. not choices but setting a variable that can be referred later - e.g. having an item in inventory or specific piece of knowledge). Ability to remove variables.
- TEST FRAMEWORK
- Logging
- Screen resolution scaleability (settings menu in general)
- Background image markup should allow setting an actual image and not just change colour.
- Font markup should also have a type to change font size and colour.
- Load fonts as resources for each story

Known Bugs

- Text can go across the border of the window - this seems to be for non-choice choices' text
- Text is not contained in Choicebox. Make shared box code for ensuring boundaries are respected.
- At a choice loop an extra line loop seems to be added
- When loading a game we go to the start of a segment even if the save was in the middle, after choices in the segment. We should start after the last choice made.

Nice Things With No Current Release Version

- Scroll bar to look at previous text
- It might be worthwhile redoing the markup format and not do a single forward pass type thing but rather use getLine format.
- Unify addBranch and addValue
- Proper text box asking user if should overwrite saved game
- Loading a game should check if choice history is valid
- Timed text, cna be used anywhere but specifically for showing that a game has been saved

Features With No Current Release Version
- Rumble effect (vary pos for draw)
- Colour effect
- Ability to change background
- Text appearance method markup
- Random choices
- Negative Conditional Choices
- Choices whose text is different when choosing from when put on screen after

A Little Bit Far Of Features

- TTS reading
- ASR choices
- Graphical Story Writing Tool (drag and drop diagram style)

Questions

- Is there any benefit to the string/double definition of markup types?
- Is there a benefit to just-in-time parsing and having the parser own optional stuff depending on previous choices?
