# StoryTime
A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Story Interpreter

Prerequisites:

A C++17 compatible compiler. As this project isn't expected to be done before c++17 is a common standard I've opted for using c++17.
C++17 gives, crucially, the std::filesystem which is just such a useful thing. G++-8 onwards has support for std::filesystem and C++17.

SFML-2.5 installed. Can be gotten from https://www.sfml-dev.org/

In the interpreters current state you also need to add a font in resources/fonts/rosegarden/ this will probably change in the future, but this current working font can be found here:

You can of course put any font in there you like.
