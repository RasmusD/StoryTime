A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Story Interpreter

Note: In the interpreters current state you need to add a font in a directory called resources/fonts/rosegarden. this will probably change in the future, but this current working font can be found here:

https://www.dafont.com/rosegarden-2.font

You can of course put any font in there you like.
