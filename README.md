A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Story Interpreter

Note: In the interpreters current state you need to add SFML 2.4 libraries in lib/ and a font in resources/fonts/rosegarden/ this will probably change in the future, but this current working font can be found here:

You can of course put any font in there you like.

SFML is available from here:
